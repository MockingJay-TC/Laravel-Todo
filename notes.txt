Mini Todo App in laravel;

todos: table

title: string
completed: boolean


Now we have to create model todo for the todo table

then a migration for ctreating the table of todo

now we need some routes to use CRUD on the todo

then a controller, where we can put all the logics of the CRUD so we can easily interact 

using php artisan all these can be done using eloquent.


1. after creating all these,
add the  needed fields to the migration file,
then php artisan migrate

2. creating views and routes

go to web.php and create a get route to return the index view of the todo

controller -> "name" + Controller
view -> blade.php 
Routes -> web.php
